Theme Bundle
============

> This project is created form [LiipThemeBundle](https://github.com/liip/LiipThemeBundle) for twig 3.* 

This bundle provides you the possibility to add themes to each bundle. In your
bundle directory it will look under `Resources/themes/<themename>` or fall back
to the normal Resources/views if no matching file was found.

## Installation

Installation is a quick (I promise!) 3 step process:

1. Download LiipThemeBundle
2. Enable the Bundle
3. Import LiipThemeBundle routing

### Step 1: Install LiipThemeBundle with composer

Run the following composer require command:

``` bash
$ php composer.phar require liip/theme-bundle

```

### Step 2: Enable the bundle

Finally, enable the bundle in the kernel:

``` php
<?php
// app/AppKernel.php

public function registerBundles()
{
    $bundles = array(
        // ...
        new Liip\ThemeBundle\LiipThemeBundle(),
    );
}
```

### Step 3: Import LiipThemeBundle routing files

Now that you have activated and configured the bundle, all that is left to do is
import the LiipThemeBundle routing files.

In YAML:

``` yaml
# app/config/routing.yml
liip_theme:
    resource: "@LiipThemeBundle/Resources/config/routing.xml"
    prefix: /theme
```

Or if you prefer XML:

``` xml
<!-- app/config/routing.xml -->
<import resource="@LiipThemeBundle/Resources/config/routing.xml" prefix="/theme" />
```

## Configuration

You will have to set your possible themes and the currently active theme. It
is required that the active theme is part of the themes list.

``` yaml
# app/config/config.yml
liip_theme:
    themes: ['standardTheme', 'winter_theme', 'weekend']
    active_theme: 'standardTheme'
```

### Device specific themes/templates

You can provide specific themes or even templates for different devices (like: desktop, tablet, phone, plain). Set option ```autodetect_theme``` to true for setting ```current_device``` parameter based on the user agent:

``` yaml
# app/config/config.yml
liip_theme:
    autodetect_theme: true
```

Then in ```path_patterns``` you can use ```%%current_device%%``` parameter (with your device type as value)

``` yaml
# app/config/config.yml
liip_theme:
    path_patterns:
        app_resource:
            - %%app_path%%/themes/%%current_theme%%/%%current_device%%/%%template%%
            - %%app_path%%/themes/fallback_theme/%%current_device%%/%%template%%
            - %%app_path%%/views/%%current_device%%/%%template%%
```

Optionally ``autodetect_theme`` can also be set to a DIC service id that implements
the ``Liip\ThemeBundle\Helper\DeviceDetectionInterface`` interface.

### Get active theme information from cookie

If you want to select the active theme based on a cookie you can add:

``` yaml
# app/config/config.yml
liip_theme:
    cookie:
        name: NameOfTheCookie
        lifetime: 31536000 # 1 year in seconds
        path: /
        domain: ~
        secure: false
        http_only: false
```

### Disable controller based theme switching

If your application doesn't allow the user to switch theme, you can deactivate
the controller shipped with the bundle:

``` yaml
# app/config/config.yml
liip_theme:
    load_controllers: false
```

### Theme Cascading Order

The following order is applied when checking for templates that live in a bundle, for example `@BundleName/Resources/template.html.twig`
with theme name ``phone`` is located at:

1. Override themes directory: `app/Resources/themes/phone/BundleName/template.html.twig`
2. Override view directory: `app/Resources/BundleName/views/template.html.twig`
3. Bundle theme directory: `src/BundleName/Resources/themes/phone/template.html.twig`
4. Bundle view directory: `src/BundleName/Resources/views/template.html.twig`

For example, if you want to integrate some TwigBundle custom error pages regarding your theme
architecture, you will have to use this directory structure :
`app/Resources/themes/phone/TwigBundle/Exception/error404.html.twig`

The following order is applied when checking for application-wide base templates, for example `::template.html.twig`
with theme name ``phone`` is located at:

1. Override themes directory: `app/Resources/themes/phone/template.html.twig`
2. Override view directory: `app/Resources/views/template.html.twig`

#### Change Theme Cascading Order

You able change cascading order via configurations directives: `path_patterns.app_resource`, `path_patterns.bundle_resource`, `path_patterns.bundle_resource_dir`. For example:

``` yaml
# app/config/config.yml
liip_theme:
    path_patterns:
        app_resource:
            - %%app_path%%/themes/%%current_theme%%/%%template%%
            - %%app_path%%/themes/fallback_theme/%%template%%
            - %%app_path%%/views/%%template%%
        bundle_resource:
            - %%bundle_path%%/Resources/themes/%%current_theme%%_%%current_device%%/%%template%%
            - %%bundle_path%%/Resources/themes/%%current_theme%%/%%template%%
            - %%bundle_path%%/Resources/themes/fallback_theme/%%template%%
        bundle_resource_dir:
            - %%dir%%/themes/%%current_theme%%/%%bundle_name%%/%%template%%
            - %%dir%%/themes/fallback_theme/%%bundle_name%%/%%template%%
            - %%dir%%/%%bundle_name%%/%%override_path%%
```

### Change Active Theme

For that matter have a look at the ThemeRequestListener.

If you are early in the request cycle and no template has been rendered you
can still change the theme without problems. For this the theme service
exists at:

``` php
$activeTheme = $container->get('liip_theme.active_theme');
echo $activeTheme->getName();
$activeTheme->setName("phone");
```

### Theme Specific Controllers

In some situations, a different template is not enough and you need a different 
controller for a specific theme. We encountered this with A/B testing. Do not 
abuse this feature and check whether your use case is still to be considered a 
theme.

This feature is not active by default as there is an additional request 
listener involved. Enable it by setting `theme_specific_controllers` in your 
configuration:


```yaml
# app/config/config.yml
liip_theme:
    # ...
    theme_specific_controllers: true
```

Now you can configure controllers per theme in your routing file:

```yaml
my_route:
    path: /x/y
    defaults:
        _controller: my_service:fooAction
        theme_controllers:
            a: my_other_service:fooAction
            b: App:Other:foo
```

As usual, you can use both the service notation or the namespace notation for
the controllers. Just specify the controller by theme under the key 
`theme_controllers`.

### Assetic integration

Because of the way the LiipThemeBundle overrides the template locator service,
assetic will only dump the assets of the active theme.

In order to dump the assets of all themes enable the ``assetic_integration``
option:

````yaml
# app/config/config.yml
liip_theme:
    # ...
    assetic_integration: true
````

This will override the Twig formula loader and iterate over all of the themes,
ensuring that all of the assets are dumped.

Note that this only works with AsseticBundle 2.1 or higher.

### Override the Device Detection

It is possible to override the service used for the device detection. Make sure to either
extend `DeviceDetection` or implement `DeviceDetectionInterface`:

````yaml
# app/config/config.yml
services:
    my_devcice_detection:
        class: SomeClass

liip_theme:
    # ...
    device_detection: my_devcice_detection
````

## Migrate to SyliusThemeBundle

This will show you the stepts to switch from the [LiipThemeBundle](https://github.com/liip/LiipThemeBundle) to [SyliusThemeBundle](https://github.com/Sylius/SyliusThemeBundle).

#### Remove the old theme bundle and install the SyliusThemeBundle:

```bash
# Remove old theme-bundle
composer remove liip/theme-bundle --no-update

# Install new theme-bundle
composer require sylius/theme-bundle:"^2.0"
```

#### Remove old configuration

The old `liip_theme.yaml` configuration needs to be removed:

```diff
-liip_theme:
-    themes: ['awesome']
-    active_theme: 'awesome'
```

In the next step you see how you configure the **awesome** theme using the SyliusThemeBundle.

#### Configure the SyliusThemeBundle:

In order to use the bundle you have to add the following default configuration:

```yaml
# ./config/packages/sylius_theme.yaml

sylius_theme:
    sources:
        filesystem: ~
```

By default, the bundle seeks for the themes in the `%kernel.project_dir%/themes` directory and looks for a configuration
file named `composer.json`. This can be changed via the yaml configuration:

```yaml
sylius_theme:
    sources:
        filesystem:
            filename: theme.json
```

#### Convert Theme Configuration

In the SyliusThemeBundle every theme must have its own configuration file in form of a `theme.json`.
Add a `theme.json` file and add the following minimal configuration:

```diff
{
    "name": "app/awesome"
}
```

Go to the [Theme Configuration Reference](https://github.com/Sylius/SyliusThemeBundle/blob/master/docs/theme_configuration_reference.md)
for the detailed documentation about the configuration options.

Most likely you have to change the theme name. It is important, that the `name` matches the naming convention of composer (`vendor/name`).
Furthermore the `theme.json` has to be moved into the directory for this specific theme. 

For example: `%kernel.project_dir%/themes/awesome/theme.json`

#### Update project structure

Your templates have to be placed in a `templates` directory next to the `theme.json` file.

For example: `%kernel.project_dir%/themes/<theme-name>/templates`

This results in the following project structure:

```
ProjectName
├── composer.json
├── assets
├── bin
├── config
├── templates
├── themes
│   ├── awesome
│   │   ├── templates
│   │   │   └── base.html.twig
│   │   └── theme.json
│   └── <theme-name-2>
│       ├── templates
│       │   └── base.html.twig
│       └── theme.json
├── ...
└── ...
```

As you can see in the project structure, each theme must have their own `theme.json` configuration file next to the
templates directory.

#### Create ThemeRequestListener

You need to create a ThemeRequestListener to set the theme based on the current `$request` data:

```php
use Sylius\Bundle\ThemeBundle\Context\SettableThemeContext;
use Sylius\Bundle\ThemeBundle\Repository\ThemeRepositoryInterface;
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Event\GetResponseEvent;
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\HttpKernelInterface;

final class ThemeRequestListener
{
    /** @var ThemeRepositoryInterface */
    private $themeRepository;

    /** @var SettableThemeContext */
    private $themeContext;

    public function __construct(ThemeRepositoryInterface $themeRepository, SettableThemeContext $themeContext)
    {
        $this->themeRepository = $themeRepository;
        $this->themeContext = $themeContext;
    }

    public function onKernelRequest(GetResponseEvent $event): void
    {
        if (HttpKernelInterface::MASTER_REQUEST !== $event->getRequestType()) {
            // don't do anything if it's not the master request
            return;
        }

        $themeName = 'app/awesome';

        // here you can set the $themeName based on $event->getRequest() object

        $this->themeContext->setTheme(
            $this->themeRepository->findOneByName($themeName)
        );
    }
}
```
